	                     <p align="justify"> Wireless sensing has recently attracted a lot of attention thanks to its non-intrusive 
				     and sensor-free nature. Contrary to the traditional sensor-based and wearable sensing, wireless sensing does not
				     need any sensors but leverages the signal distortions and machine learning algorithms for sensing. 
				     Moreover, wireless signals can propagate through walls which allows sensing to be performed even in non-line-of 
				     sight (NLOS) scenarios which increases the sensing coverage over camera-based systems. 
				     Different types of wireless signals have been employed for sensing including WiFi, RFID, mmWave, UWB, 
				     and acoustic signals. As wireless signals bounce off of physical objects within the environment such as 
				     static objects like walls or furniture as well as any humans in the environment, their characteristics 
				     (e.g., amplitude, phase) change uniquely. This then provides an opportunity to 
				     sense the environment and obtain contextual information (e.g., recognizing the motion) 
				     through a fine-grained analysis of signal variations. 
				     Wireless sensing has been considered in various applications including but not limited to localization, 
				     human activity and gesture recognition, gait estimation, fall detection, respiration monitoring and 
				     crowd counting.</p>
				  
			<p align="justify"> Deploying the wireless sensing systems on edge devices is also important, to reduce their costs and make them scalable. 
				However, this comes with several challenges due to the constrained resources (e.g., memory, computation power, energy) of edge nodes. 
				Accordingly, in this workshop we also look for solutions that develop novel, lightweight and cost-efficient techniques that can run at the network edge, providing means
				to train and run machine learning models in an energy efficient manner, both according to centralized and distributed training paradigms. 
				We are also interested in the characterization of energetic aspects on currently available edge computing technology, including but not limited to empirical energy models.</p>

<p align="justify">Percom 2024 is also inviting authors of all the accepted workshop papers to get their code and data validated in an artifact evaluation process. Authors who choose to participate can provide supplementary materials as artifacts (tools, applications, data sets, etc.) that will be reviewed solely for functional completeness (e.g., does provided code compile and run as expected?; do experimental results match expected results?, etc.). 

<p align="justify">Participating authors will be allotted two additional pages in a separate Artifacts section of the proceedings to describe the nature and contents of the artifact package. Submission of artifacts packages will have no bearing on paper acceptance or publication. However, papers that have verified artifacts or data will be associated with badges in the conference program and proceedings. Two badges will be available: Artifact-Certified and Result-Certified. Upon submission, participating authors should indicate which badge(s) the committee should consider for the submission.

<p align="justify">Artifacts of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:
	<ul>			       
			     
 <li> Software, including implementations or simulations of systems or algorithms.</li>

			       <strong>Title:</strong> "From WiFi Sensing to Quantum Sensing: Toward a Wireless Sensing Theory" <br>
			       <p align="justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>
				WiFi/4G/5G based wireless sensing has attracted a lot of attention from both academia and industry in the last decade. 
				However, most of the work focused on developing effective techniques for a certain application, very few work attempted to explore the fundamental sensing theory and answer 
				fundamental questions such as the sensing limit, sensing boundary and sensing quality of WiFi/4G/5G signals. In this talk, I will first introduce the Fresnel zone model as a generic theoretic basis 
				for device-free and contactless human sensing with WiFi/4G/5G signals, revealing the relationship among the received CSI signal, the distance between the two transceivers, 
				the location and heading of the sensing target with respect to the transceivers, and the environment. Then we propose to define the Sensing Signal to Noise Ratio (SSNR) as a new metric to inform the sensing limit, 
				sensing boundary and sensing signal quality of WiFi/4G/5G-based human sensing systems. In order to further increase SSNR and push the wireless sensing limit, we explore the Rydberg theory about 
				how the Rydberg atom interacts with RF signals and develop the world first Rydberg quantum sensing system which senses tiny variations of RF signals caused by human activities, showing 
				significant performance increase compared to WiFi or Radar based sensing systems.
